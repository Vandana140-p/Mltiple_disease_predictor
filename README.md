# Multiple Diseases Predictor

This project is a *Multiple Diseases Predictor* developed in Python, designed to predict the likelihood of various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. Using specific health metrics, the model applies multiple machine learning techniques to provide accurate and reliable predictions across different diseases.

## Datasets

The predictor uses the following datasets:

- *Cardiovascular Disease Dataset*: Contains data such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and smoking habits to help identify risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
  
- *Metabolic Disease Dataset*: Includes information like glucose levels, BMI, family history, and dietary habits, which are essential indicators for metabolic diseases like diabetes.

- *Parkinson’s Disease Dataset*: Contains symptoms such as tremors, posture instability, and motor function issues, which are key for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease.

## Algorithms Used

The model incorporates several machine learning algorithms to maximize prediction accuracy:

- *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*: This algorithm is effective for classification tasks, especially when dealing with complex patterns in the data.

- *Logistic Regression*: A suitable choice for binary classification problems, offering straightforward, interpretable results.

- *Decision Trees*: Known for capturing non-linear relationships, Decision Trees are useful for understanding how different factors contribute to disease risk.

- *Random Forest*: An ensemble method that improves accuracy by combining the results of multiple decision trees, making it more robust for diverse datasets.
